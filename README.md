# My Personal Project

## What will the application do?
My application will be a Cafe ordering Menu, where users will be able to select and customize their order. 
The owner of this Cafe can add what ever drink or bakery item they want to their ordering menu.

## Who will use it?
People who would go to this Cafe and want to order their drinks or food and pay up front, so they can skip the line.
Busy Cafes can use this to help speed up their lines.
